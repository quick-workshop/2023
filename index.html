    <h1>Welcome to the 2nd International Workshop <br>
	     on Urgent Analytics for the Computing Continuum</h1>
    <p>
        Urgent Analytics refers to a class of scientific applications that enable important decision-making under strict time and quality constraints while maintaining desired confidence. The overall goal of Urgent Computing is to predict the outcome of scenarios early enough to prevent critical situations or to mitigate their negative consequences.
</p>
	<p>
		This workshop seeks scientific contributions that leverage the aggregation of heterogeneous resources along the data path from the Edge to the Cloud/HPC, also known as the Computing Continuum, to support critical analytics applications. Data-driven dynamic workflows, which combine knowledge from multiple data sources and integrate it on-demand with distributed, large-scale computational models, are some of the canonical use cases for this theme.
    </p>

  </p>
	<h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
        Integrating urgent analytics with geo-distributed resources is hindered by a lack of abstractions and software stacks that can support data-driven reactive behaviors, i.e., for determining what, where, and when data is collected and processed across the edge-to-cloud/HPC computing continuum. Managing data-driven applications requires programming models and resource management for adaptive strategies, able to effectively react to unexpected events and trigger appropriate actions. Such contributions have the potential to address today's global grand challenges in science, engineering, and society. 
    </p>
	
<p>
		We are looking for original high-quality research on urgent applications across the continuum where real-timeliness, reliability and scalability are the main factors to pursue.T opics in the following topical areas are of particular interest, plus others that are not explicitly listed but are closely related: 
</p>
<ul>
			<li>- Algorithms, models and systems considerations in designing urgent applications across the Computing Continuum</li>
			<li>- Programming support for user expectations and constraints in terms of response time, solution quality, data resolution, cost, energy, etc.</li>
			<li>- Run-time techniques to provide flexible execution models for computation and communication.</li>
			<li>- Resource management frameworks and interfaces supporting scheduling, resource allocations and application execution for the computing continuum.</li>
			<li>- Use of AI and ML techniques to steer urgency in systems and applications.</li>
			<li>- Experiences and use cases applying urgent science and emergency to computing continuum infrastructures.</li>
			<li>- Edge Intelligence models, Autonomic Computing and Distributed Machine Learning</li>
			<li>- Policy driven service and resource life-cycle management</li>
			<li>- Feedback, Control and Observability for the Continuum</li>
			<li>- Data analysis techniques and network solutions for emergency prediction and disaster management</li>
			<li>- Opportunistic and ad-hoc communication systems</li>
</ul>
